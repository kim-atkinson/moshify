<!-- This is the benefit of object-oriented css, separating structure "icon" from skin "icon--primary" to create different skins which can later be combined to achieve different results -->

<span class="icon-container">
  <svg class="icon icon--primary">
    <use xlink:href="images/sprite.svg#wordpress"></use>
  </svg>
</span>
